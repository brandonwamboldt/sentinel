Sentinel HTTPd
==============

> **DISCLAIMER:** This is a hobby project and doesn't even work right now.

Sentinel is an event driven HTTP server for *nix platforms.

Architecture
------------

- Event driven IO using `epoll`
- Single threaded

Status
------

So this compiles on Ubuntu and you can load it in the web browser (port 3000), but it is only capable of displaying the built in 404 page right now.
